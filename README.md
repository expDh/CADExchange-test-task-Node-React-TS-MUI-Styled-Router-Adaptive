This project was developed as a test assignment for the company **CAD Exchange**.

Submitted data is sent to a backend server implemented using Express and TypeScript, where it is logged to the console.

The contact form includes the following fields:
- Name
- Email
- Message

After successful submission, the user sees a confirmation message indicating that the data was received by the server.
